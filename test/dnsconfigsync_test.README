This test requires that special measures are taken to run.

To run this test you will need:

1. A running BIND9 instance.
2. Proper ssh keys to the root user of this system.

DO NOT:

1. Run this on a system with a production DNS server.
2. Run this on a system where having root access can lead to catastrphic
   repurcussions.
3. Make the ssh keys in test_data visible by anyone but the user this test
   is run.

To set up this unittest:

1. Generate an ssh key and place it in test_data.
   Name it roster_id_dsa.pub. Make sure to chmod 600.
2. Add this key to /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
3. Install and start a disposable BIND9 server.
4. Generate an rndc key file named rndc.key and copy it to the bind directory
   and test_data.
